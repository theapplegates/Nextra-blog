But it paid off the last time they made\nthat gamble: we ended up with a little thing called the World Wide Web. Let's\nsee if they can do it again.\n— AaronRead Aaron's original post:\nBuilding Programmable Web Sites by Aaron Swartz, 2009.","quotes-about-www#Quotes About WWW":"“(the Internet) It should be kept open. It should be kept free.” – Steve Jobs\n“The third reason it’s very exciting is that Microsoft doesn’t own it and I\ndon’t think they can. It’s the one thing in the industry that Microsoft can\nprobably never own. I think one of the things that’s essential is that the\ngovernment continue to fund the Internet as a public trust, as a public\nfacility and remove any of these ridiculous notions of privatizing it that\nhave been brought up. I don’t think they’re going to fly, thankfully.” –\nSteve Jobs\nJacques Mattheij wrote an article, about the web in 2050, which feels like\nthe New Speak in George Orwell's 1984.","quotes-from-aarons-post#Quotes from Aaron’s Post":"About API\nAPIs only let you look at the data in a particular way, typically the way\nthat the hosting site looks at it\nAbout API, II (Q: differences between data, protocol, API?)\npass the noun to the verb: /share?v=1234 pass the verb to the noun:\n/v/1234?m=share\nThen he describes the interesting hybrid that the Web adopted, which he terms\n\"Representational State Transfer\" or REST.About “standard” vs “design”\nAnd instead of spending time building things, they've convinced people\ninterested in these ideas that the first thing we need to do is write\nstandards. (To engineers, this is absurd from the start -- standards are\nthings you write after you've got something working, not before!)\nFortunately for us, the Web was designed with this future in mind. The protocols\nthat underpin it are not designed simply to provide pages for human consumption,\nbut also to easily accommodate the menagerie of spiders, bots, and scripts that\nexplore its fertile soil. ...for applications.Then we'll look into what it means for your application to be not just another\ntool for people and software to use, but part of the ecology -- a section of\nthe programmable web. This means exposing your data to be queried and copied and\nintegrated, even without explicit permission, into the larger software\necosystem, while protecting users' freedom.The more likely option is, of course, to break away from the Web altogether, and\nforce people to download special software to use your application. ... If that's\na choice you want to make, you probably shouldn't be reading this book.This is one of the secrets of success on the Web: the more you send people away,\nthe more they come backAbout URL and URI\nMoreover, URLs do not just exist as isolated entities\nURLs shouldn't change (and if they do change, the old ones should redirect to\nthe new ones) so they should only contain information about the page that never\nchanges. This leads to some obvious requirements.First, URLs shouldn't include technical details of the software you used to\nbuild your website, since that could change at any momentAbout TBL\nAnd even then, they're far more limited than the wide-reaching interactivity\nthat Berners-Lee imagined.\nInstead, they used the clone created by a team at the University of Illinois\nUrbana-Champaign (UIUC), which never supported editing because programmer Marc\nAndreesen was too dumb to figure out how to do page editing with inline\npictures, something Tim Berners-Lee's version had no problem with.(related: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/mylifewithtim)","external-links#External links":"Steve Jobs interview: One-on-one in 1995\nSolid: Re-decentralizing the web\nAaron’s public links & notes tagged with “web” on Pinboard\n“URLs shouldn't include technical details”: 天猫首页\nSemantic Web – W3C\nTim Berners-Lee: The next web\nThe Web in 2050 · Jacques Mattheij:\n“reboot the web”"}},"/posts/callout":{"title":"Callout","data":{"callout#Callout":"","default#Default":"This is a default callout.","error#Error":"This is an error callout.","info#Info":"This is an info callout.","warning#Warning":"This is a warning callout.","with-custom-emoji-#With custom emoji ":"This is a callout with a custom emoji.","steps#Steps":"","step-1#Step 1":"Content for step 1.","step-2#Step 2":"Contents for step 2.","tabs#Tabs":"pnpm: Fast, disk space efficient package manager.\nnpm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.\nYarn is a software packaging system.","filetree#FileTree":"","cards#Cards":"With custom emojiThis is an info callout."}},"/posts/code-blocks":{"title":"Code blocks","data":{"test-filename-line-highlighting-and-empty-lines#Test filename, line highlighting and empty lines":"console.log('hello world')\nconsole.log('goodbye world')","test-showlinenumbers-and-word-highlighting#Test showLineNumbers and word highlighting":"object Hello {\n  def main(args: Array[String]) = {\n    println(\"hello, world\")\n  }\n}\nobject Hello {\n  def main(args: Array[String]) = {\n    println(\"hello, world\")\n  }\n}","test-highlighting-inline-code#Test highlighting inline code":"import React from 'react'{:js}","test-without-specified-language#Test without specified language":"hello world","test-link-in-code#Test link in code":"Link to googleLink to GitHub"}},"/posts/draft":{"title":"Draft","data":{"":"Because this post has draft: true defined in its frontmatter, it won't show up\nin the list of posts or\nlist of posts by tag but can be access directly by\nits url at /posts/draft."}},"/posts":{"title":"Random Thoughts","data":{}},"/posts/table":{"title":"Table","data":{"test-table#Test table":"Left\tCenter\tRight\tRight\tRight\tRight\tRight\tRight\tRight\tRight\tss2\t333\t3232\t3232\t3232\t3232\t3232\t3232\t3232\t3232\t\t222\t3232\t3232\t3232\t3232\t3232\t3232\t3232\t3232\t\t23"}},"/tags/[tag]":{"title":"Posts Tagged with “”","data":{}}}
